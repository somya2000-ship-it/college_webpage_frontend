        <em style="font-size: 40px;">Most Widely Spoken Foreign Languages</em><br><br>  
        <img class="image" src="https://cdn.studyfrenchspanish.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Which-Foreign-Language-to-Learn.png" alt="lang img">  
        <h2>1. Mandarin Chinese (普通话 / Pǔtōnghuà)</h2>
        <p>More than a billion people speak Mandarin Chinese across the world.</p>

        <p>The 21st century belongs to China, and knowing the Chinese language will allow you to compete effectively in the global economy of the future.</p>
            
        <p>China has become an enormous market. International businesses and companies are looking for people who can talk in Chinese and operate successfully in China’s cultural context.</p>
            
        <p>Since very few people speak Chinese in India, proficiency in Chinese may give you an edge when competing for a vital position in any firm.</p>
            
        <p> Beyond the five most popular foreign languages in India, the following five other useful ones are Portuguese, Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Korean.</p>
   

    <h2>2. Korean (한국어 / Hangugeo)</h2>
    <p>Korean is the official language of South and North Korea. South Korea has a strong growing economy and the 7th largest export economy in the world.</p>

     <p>The interest in Korean courses is rising northward in India due to the tremendous demand for Korean specialists in many International Korean companies such as Samsung, LG, Kia, Hyundai, Posco, Lotte, etc.</p>
        
    <p>There is also growing demand due to K-drama, K-pop, and K-movies.</p>
        
    <p>It increases your potential market and job possibilities in Korean companies and companies that deal with businesses in South Korea.</p>
        
    <p>The reason is the excellent pay package and comparatively lesser competition.</p>
        
    <p>If you decide to go with Korea, take the TOPIK test to earn an international certification.</p>
 
    <h2>3. Japanese (日本語 / Nihongo)</h2>
    <p>Demand for the Japanese language is high due to growing India-Japan relations and Japanese companies expanding Indian operations.</p>

    <p>Japan is synonymous with high quality and technologically advanced products.</p>
        
    <p>Japanese is the most popular choice among East Asian languages in India.</p>
        
    <p>Since Japanese has a reputation for being difficult to learn, there is less competition for job positions with Japanese-speaking applicants.</p>
        
    <p>Suppose you’re looking for a foreign language that is highly paid in India. In that case, Japanese is the language that gets you paid the most in India and abroad.</p>
        
    <p>The career Scope of Japanese is astonishing if you accomplish a high level of proficiency like JLPT N2.</p>

    <h2>4. French (Français)</h2>
    <p>French is the most popular foreign language to learn in India.</p>

    <p>Since French is part of most School and College curriculum, More than 1 lakh students study French in Delhi / NCR only. Add other Indian cities, and the number will be staggering high.</p>
        
    <p>French is also one of the best foreign languages to learn for jobs in corporate sectors in India.</p>
        
    <p>Many multinational companies use French as their working language in a wide range of industries. It includes fashion, education, banking and finance, export and import, traveling, retailing, education, automotive, luxury goods, aeronautics, etc.</p>
        
    <p>Learning French can be a career asset in several sectors.</p>
        
    <p>The career benefits of French is immense.</p>
        
    <p>With over 30 French-speaking countries, French is spoken across five different continents and is the second most studied language globally.</p>

    <h2>5. Spanish (Español)</h2>
    <p>With 20 Spanish-speaking countries, It is one of the most widely spoken languages globally.</p>

    <p>The Spanish language is the third most popular foreign language to learn after French & German.</p>
        
    <p>There are multiple reasons to learn Spanish.</p>
        
    <p> Numerous career paths like Travel and Tourism, journalism, foreign service, and international business exist.</p>
        
    <p>You can also find jobs in BPO, translation, interpretation, language teaching, for which proficiency in spoken and written Spanish can be a valuable asset.</p>
        
    <p>There is a growing business relationship between India and Hispanic countries, especially South and Central America. Besides, in the USA, it is the second most spoken language.</p>
        
    <p>The popularity of Spanish Football, Music, and Movies are a few more reasons people opt for Spanish courses in India.</p>

    <h2>6. Russian (русский / Rússkiy)</h2>
    <p>The Russian language is popular in India for a very long time.</p>

    <p>However, the demand has declined in the last decade or so. It is spoken by over 300 million people around the world.</p>
        
    <p>It is the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia and the largest native language in Europe.</p>
        
    <p>Due to India and Russia’s historical and friendly relationship, It has many opportunities in the Engineering, Science & Technology, Oil & Gas, and Defense sector.</p>
        
    <p>The Russian language gives access to rich Russian literature and scientific literature of the country. It is a barometer of Russian soft power.</p>
        
    <p>There was a time when the Russian language was prevalent in India (in the top 3) and was taught in several cities and a host of universities.</p>
        
    <p>However, the loss of Russia’s superpower status was accompanied by a loss of interest in the Russian language in India.</p>
        
    <p>The Russian government has started giving adequate attention to teaching the Russian language in India.</p>
        
    <p>Will the scope of learning Russian will become widespread again?</p>
        
    <p>Only time will tell.</p>
        
    <p>With the growth of industry and the opening up of the private sector, the need for translators and interpreters proficient in Russian is evidenced in most Indian cities.</p>

    <h2>7. German (Deutsch)</h2>
    <p>Even though German is not widely spoken, such as French, Spanish, Arabic, or Chinese.</p>

    <p>It is still the second most popular foreign language in India after French.</p>
        
    <p>The five main reasons:-</p>
        
        <p>i) The most spoken mother tongue in Europe. It is the official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and more.</p> 
        <P>ii) Germany is an economic powerhouse. And the ability to speak German offers plenty of job opportunities in many big German companies such as Volkswagen, BASF, Daimler, BMW, Bosch, Siemens, etc. German is a top choice in the field of Science, Engineering, Automobile, etc.</p>
        <p>iii) The German language is part of an academic curriculum in more than 500 Schools and Colleges in India, including more than 250 Kendriya Vidyalayas alone.</p>
        <p>iv) “First Move advantage” – Like the French, the German government promoted German in India several decades back. In 1957, the first “Max Mueller Bhavan” was inaugurated in Kolkata. The first German lessons in India were imparted in Pune and Mumbai in 1914 (more than a century back).</p>
        <p>v) Germany’s universities have an excellent international reputation and among the best in the world. Thanks to a wide array of scholarships, German proficiency plays a crucial role if you plan to go to Germany or Austria for higher studies.</p>

    <h2>8. Italian (Italiano)</h2>    
    <p>Italian is the eighth largest economy and ranks as one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Italian is the most romantic of the romance languages.</p>

    <p>Several International Italian companies like Banco, Fiat, Benetton, Gucci, Lloyd, Ferrari, Marconi, and Pinnacle have set up their businesses in India and looking for those who speak Italian.</p>
        
    <p>There are lots of Italian language specialist jobs in India.</p>
        
    <p>The scope of Italian in India is increasing at a steady pace. If you want to make your career in this beautiful language, then go ahead.</p>
        
    <p>The future of the Italian language looks bright. Italian is also relatively easy to learn for Indians compare with other European languages like French, German, or Russian.</p>
   
    <h2>9. Portuguese (Português) </h2>
    <p>The Portuguese language is the 6th most spoken language in the world.</p>

    <p>The demand for Portuguese is multiplying due to the rising strength of Brazil’s economy & the growing relationship between India and Brazil.</p>
        
    <p>All the eight Portuguese speaking-countries, including Portugal and Brazil, offer a different stake for Indian interests.</p>
        
    <p>And together, they represent eight valuable votes and a lot of influence on the global stage.</p>
        
    <p>Growing relations between India and Lusophones (Portuguese speaking countries) will boost the Scope of Portuguese in India.</p>
        
    <p>There is increasing demand and scope for Portuguese Language Experts in India in various industries like Finance, Exports, Accounts, Technology, Technical Support, IT/ITES, Tourism, and Education.</p>
        
    <p>Portuguese Courses in Delhi and Goa are pretty popular.</p>

    <h2>10. Arabic (عربى / Al-‘Arabiyyah)</h2>
    <p>Arabic is the 5th most spoken language in the world.</p>

    <p>Over 300 million speakers speak as of their native language, which is beneficial in Western Asia and North Africa.</p>
        
    <p>It is one of the UN’s six official languages. It is widespread in 26 nations and, indeed, a global language.</p>
        
    <p>The Arab world has untapped economic potential and extremely rich in natural resources.</p>
        
    <p>Proficiency in Arabic opens opportunities in business, government, nonprofit, education, and beyond.</p>
        
    <p>There are many job opportunities in Arab-world and other countries as well.</p>
        
    <p>There are over 10 million Indians in this region. If you plan to move to Middle-East countries like UAE, KSA, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, etc., learning Arabic is the right thing to do.</p>
